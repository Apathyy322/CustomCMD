How to use(if you dont wanna watch the vid but i still highly recommend):
    Create your batch file, type "cmd" in your search bar on windows but instead of opening your cmd click "File Location", then right click on that shortcut -> properties and where it says Path add your path to
    batch script with double quotes. For example your cmd shorcut path would look like this: %windir%\system32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Users\User\Videos\batchforcmd\batch.bat".
